# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning
Our semester long project for CS 521- Statistical NLP. In this project, we aim to mine user reviews to detect hidden sentiments and interests that drive those sentiments. Rather than just using traditional lexical methods as the scoring approach, we experiment with neural approaches.
